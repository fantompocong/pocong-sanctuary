## Description

Victims of the Christmas Massacre in the cradle of mankind have awakened. They fell victim to violence that stems from long and systematic indiscretion that has happened since the Columbian exchange. Raised in the tropic, they’ve never seen snow. They seek no revenge, and for their devotion and strong will, they are resurrected as SnowPocong to care for others’ dreams instead.
