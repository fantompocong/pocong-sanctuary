## Description

The Bandung Conference became a turning point for countries in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe that suffered from colonialism. They chose not to choose between the two warring nations; United States (NATO) and the Soviet Union and formed a new alliance called the Non-Aligned Movement. That alliance’s name inspired the name of our community, whose members are marked with the hashtag [#NonBlokMovement](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NonBlokMovement&f=live). [#NonBlokMovement](https://twitter.com/NonBlokMovement) contains artists, writers, curators, and art critics in the meatspace who are familiar with the art world on a daily basis, but want to explore what ‘art’ is on the blockchain network and where it will bring contemporary art in the future. In this project, each member interprets the Bandung Conference with reference to visual archives, and translates them into their own aesthetic preferences. The result is a variety of artistic creations; it can look realistic, resembling a referenced archive, or it can also look very wild, deconstructing the visual form of the reference.
