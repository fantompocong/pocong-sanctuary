I would like to thanks to [Proyek Edisi](http://instagram.com/proyek.edisi) and [@CemetiInstitut](https://twitter.com/CemetiInstitut) for our yesterday ['minting performance' "Mencari Kabar"](/blog/minting-performance-mencari-kabar). It was just a really simple minting process, yet the experience was invaluable to me, and of course for other [#NonBlokMovement](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NonBlokMovement&f=live) artists who involved in the prep.

The minting performance took about 4 hours from the start until its finished. There are two main activity: 1) '_rewrite_' of the selected articles, and 2) _mint_ the articles that have been selected and divided into parts into the [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) network.

We're using at least three apps that commonly used by the the crypto community to perform the minting process of the articles into [@FantomFDN](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN) network:
1. [@discord](https://twitter.com/discord)
1. [@MetaMask](https://twitter.com/MetaMask)
1. [@FtmScanHQ](https://twitter.com/FtmScanHQ)

For most of the performance artists involved in the 'minting performance' "Mencari Kabar", this was their first interaction with blockchain technology, specifically [#NFT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hashtag_click), on their artistic journey. I believe it was also such an experience for them.

We're using two simple contract; the first one is [`MencariKabar.sol`](https://ftmscan.com/token/0xaf4dfeebdb51f829743c792872d1f38edd521925) with ERC721 standard for the _**minting**_, and the other one is [`PublicLibrary.sol`](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x5d621ecf3f80debfce22794f7be26b32764a370a) with ERC721Holder standard for the incoming 'blockchain preservation' process (we took the process' name from the [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) activity).

Currently, the artists are in the 'inspection' window, where they check are all the minted articles is the correct one. They have until August 2nd, 23:59 UTC+7 to revise and call the `postSetTokenURI` function if there was a human-error in the minting performance process yesterday.

We also would like to thanks to [@paint_swap](https://twitter.com/paint_swap) for the availability of this feature:

The `safeMint` function can be called until the end of time as long as the Fantom network is exist, so, it is possible for them to add more articles in the future. On the yesterday performance, they minted 75 ARTIKEL tokens.

They plan to submit the collection to [PaintSwap](https://paintswap.finance/), and try to sell them for two weeks. After that two weeks, if the NFTs is unsold, the Proyek Edisi's address will call the `preverse` function on Mencari Kabar's contract.

Calling that function will send the NFT(s) to the Public Library's contract which have no withdraw function so it will stay there forever afterward. The function can be called by anyone who bought and make their self as the owner of that particular ARTIKEL tokens.

The function allows you to not only support the artists by purchasing the ARTIKEL #NFT but also support the idea of '**blockchain preservation**' afterwards. We realize that what's been minted on-chain will be there and accessible by anyone, yet we think it will strengthen the idea.

Thanks again for the opportunity to be involved in this project, Proyek Edisi, @CemetiInstitut! Thanks to the artists: Azwar Ahmad, Eka Wahyuni, Ignatius Suluh Putra, Maria Silalahi, Nisa Ramadani, Pinka Oktafiatun Qumaira, Wildan Iltizam, and also [Tooftolenk](https://twitter.com/tooftolenk). Thanks also to [@bunianrealm](https://twitter.com/bunianrealm) and [@NonBlokMovement](https://twitter.com/NonBlokMovement) artists who helped us in the process.

Beside this 'minting performance', Proyek Edisi's artists also created another performance art, you can watch their previous performance of Mencari Kabar on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWP5BNgrI-Gsql1p0U_w2A). LFG!
