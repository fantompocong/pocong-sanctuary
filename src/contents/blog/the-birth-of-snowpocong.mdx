# An Introduction to SnowPocong
## The Birth of SnowPocong, The Abrupt Ending of and The Missed halcyon days
On the continent where mankind was born, humanity’s first dream began. After millions of years of living to survive attacks from predators and harsh climates, humans have begun to dream of stars. They learn to be grateful to have lived by worshiping their ancestors, and turn their prayers to the great high place where they reside after their journey on earth is complete. From that dream, humans strive to find the best place, with the spirit of exploration out of their cradle. Encountering new lands on new continents, beyond deserts and wilderness, ice bridges, and narrow seas. Mingling with the ancient hominins, struggling with the new climate of the location, and learning to navigate nature and make sense of it, made humans a creature rich in physical variety and wisdom.

From the same cradle, humans share the same DNA. From the places that will become their grave, humans contribute new views of life and death. Hundreds of thousands of years later, humanity has been divided by property and cereal-based civilizations. The world is connected by commodity threads spun by intermediaries. Humans have their own pace in actualizing themselves. However, after the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, the world changed. The discovery of two Indies by Conquistador made Time converge into a linear line. The world becomes an experimental ground for a handful of ruling classes to plant and uproot crops that bring the greatest profit to them. This traffic accommodates the conquests in the name of enlightenment, united in the creed of One World. The continent where humans came from became a harvesting ground for cheap labor to cultivate the New World and scavenge for the landlord in his own land. One sibling regards the other sibling as an evolutionary latecomer. Life has never been so terrible; death becomes a statistic for historians to study in the future.

The Ten Commandments of God that descended on the Fertile Crescent, and became the banner of Western civilization at that time, entered the heart of the human cradle of the continent. The ideology of love entered into the area where the civic leadership has exercised its own traditional values ​​and wisdom, Acholi. Even when Colonialism deemed to be finished, it left deep scars in the system of community organization. The Cold War gave birth to warlords who fought for autonomy in controlling land that in their memory had never been this free. Civilians become pawns in the power game, sacrificed as collateral damage and even worse, a show of power.

> “It was an auspicious day for us, having mass and cooking for Christmas Eve, when we were visited by the group. They started tying up people, leading them into the forest next to our village. After that I only remember the words of the prayers to the resurrected Lord, and the sound of something breaking.” — Carrot

“Twig” was raised by incessant infighting and power struggles, kidnapped while playing marbles by a power-seeking militia group. Every day, the leader’s sermons hummed the words of God, with an anesthetizing gesture, possessed by an angel, calming the trembling of Twig’s hands. Turning his tears into anger, he instantly became an army of the Holy Spirit. Spread terror in the name of God, carry out the Ten Commandments.

Meanwhile, “Carrot” grows in a community that loves her. Her job just before Christmas was sewing, patching socks for Santa. Although Carrot grew up in an area far from the hustle and bustle of the city, she remembered a missionary once screened a film about a white man being shown a life where he was not born into the world. Through a blizzard and new found gratitude, he returns home to see how wonderful life is. Carrot remembers it as it has moved her heart to give, like the main character’s generosity.

The two of them had never seen snow, not even the eternal snow of the Rwenzori Mountains.

Carrots and 399 other people were killed during the expedition of Twig’s troops on 3 days in December. Refusing to provide the Christmas party food they cooked for their families. Reject what Twigs’ and his friends practice from the 10 Commandments of God. It was Carrot who said a prayer to the resurrected Lord in front of the Liaison of Rambunctious Asy-Syaitan, known later as The LRA.

Pocong is one of the developments on how we philosophize death. The shroud for its believers is the simplest wrap to depart from this world. Seamless fabric strips us of all our greatness in life, a cautionary tale for living life generously. When the victims of the genocide could not immediately get a coffin, the Moon-splitter provided them with an alternative in the form of shroud. Wasn’t the resurrected Lord only wrapped in the shroud of Turin when He died?

Carrots and 399 other people died while preparing for Christmas, they were wrapped in cloth obtained by volunteer burials from nearby places. But the Lord knew that Carrot had never seen snow and resurrected her as SnowPocong, being the guardian of the dreams and aspirations of the living, even though her dream was only to see and feel the snow falling on his tongue. And what the victims were about to do that day, to feed each other on Christmas, are amplified to give presents to the living, reminding them for a good life they’ve lived and will live tomorrow.

## After Christmas
### General Information
    FantomPocong mint is surely slow if compared to other collections of the same size since it has different characteristics in terms of utility and else, so it is possible that not all of them will be minted after the snapshot taken. Moreover, after looking at the most recent snapshot we took, even after 10,000 FantomPocong have been minted, it is nearly impossible for every address to have exactly 25 Pocongs or multiples of them equally. So there will be some or a lot of SnowPocong unminted after 25 December 2021. And if and only if there are still SnowPocong left, here’s the detail of what will happen:

1. ### So, what will happen to the rest of the unminted SnowPocong after Christmas?
    There will be two scenarios going on concurrently, and a third scenario that will proceed if certain conditions are met.
    - **Scenario One** | SnowPocong will still be delivered as a gift, and this time to its holders. Every holder who holds 25 FantomPocong in their wallet when the snapshot is taken at 23.59 GMT+7 on the 24th of each month will get a SnowPocong with the similar rule; 25 FantomPocong = 1 SnowPocong, 50 FantomPocong = 2 SnowPocong, and so on. Note: the first giveaway to holders will take place on 25 January 2022.
    - **Scenario Two** | The mint cost of SnowPocong will be increased to 100 FTM. Everyone who does not have FantomPocong in their wallet can mint a SnowPocong **directly** on the contract for 100 FTM each.
    - **Scenario Three** |  Only will take place after 10,000 of FantomPocong are minted but there are still some SnowPocong left unminted. The mint cost of SnowPocong will be increased to 150 FTM. Everyone who does not have FantomPocong in their wallet can mint a SnowPocong **directly** on the contract for 150 FTM each. But at the same time **Scenario One** will continue with adjustments: you need to hold 50 FantomPocong in your wallet to be eligible to receive 1 SnowPocong when the snapshot is taken at 23.59 GMT+7 on the 24th of each month.
        There will be no maximum number of SnowPocong that can be held in an address. That means you can still receive free SnowPocong once a month if you hold them and the SnowPocong supply is still available.
    - **Important Note** | All of the above scenarios that include giveaways to holders will be based on how much FantomPocong you hold. If the supply of SnowPocong reaches a total of 400 before all eligible holders receive the free SnowPocong, then no compensation will be given. Those who hold more FantomPocong will be prioritized to receive the giveaways.
1. ### When will the snapshot be taken, again?
    At 23:59 GMT+7 on the 24th of each month.
1. ### Will the team do it manually?
    Yes. We will try our best to send them on time each month until the 400 of SnowPocong are minted out.

---
**Another important note** | The team may change, amend, add to, or delete any term or condition of this FAQs, including, but not limited to, the amount of minting costs or giveaway methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of the change on our Twitter. The change will be effective upon the date of the notice unless otherwise provided. But hopefully we don’t need to do it.

# Epilog

The history of one nation is written by the victors, and consequently the world. What happened to the poor people that fell victim to the Christmas Massacre is bred by violence that stems from long and systematic indiscretion that has happened since the Columbian exchange (15th century, the discovery of America). What we can do to sever this chain reaction is to remember the victims and seek justice constantly, like we humans did from the beginning of time to our ancestors. For their death will serve as both cautionary tales for abused power and a new bible for resilience to defend the marginalized and the oppressed. The SnowPocong will accompany the [FantomPocong](/blog/introduction-to-fantompocong) as they seek justice, supporting the break of the cycle by making examples of their generosity.
